In your words, explain why the following text would NOT be considered valid HTML syntax. Additionally, predict if 'Will I be seen?' will show in the browser. Explain why or why not. Save your written answer to a file called syntax.md.


```
<html>
  <head>
    <body>
      Will I be seen?
    </body>
  </head>
</html>
```


This code is not consider valid HTML because the head and body tags supposed to be siblings. If we test this code the browser will show the text, just like will fix tags that we forgot to close. The browser is 'smart' and will always try to fix mistakes but because of this doesn't mean that we have the freedom to do whatever we want. We should always try to follow the standards of W3C.
